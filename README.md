# Mini tutorials
Adding mini tutorials on things that took me a while to solve in order to help others who have the same problem.

* Tutorial 1: [How to install any ruby versions on MacBook Pro with Chip Apple M1 Pro](install_ruby_MacBook_M1_chip.md).
* Tutorial 2: [Add byebug as remote process](remote_byebug.md).
